# Customer relationship management
- This project is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application built using Spring Boot and MongoDB. 
- It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer data via a command-line interface.

## Features
- Create a new customer
- Retrieve all customers
- Update an existing customer
- Delete a customer
- Fetch customers by specific criteria (e.g., bill amount range, address)
## Setup MongoDB
- Create a [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file
- run docker compose: `docker-compose up -d`
- Verify MySQL Docker container is running: `docker ps`
- [Download MongoDB shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
- Open MongoDB shell
  ```bash
  Please enter a MongoDB connection string (Default: mongodb://localhost/): mongodb://root:root123@localhost:27017/admin
  ```
- **Configure** `application.properties` or `application.yml`:
  ```properties
  spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
  spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
  spring.data.mongodb.database=mydatabase
  spring.data.mongodb.username=root
  spring.data.mongodb.password=root123
  spring.data.mongodb.authentication-database=admin
  ```
